The answer is simple… stay home! But before you unpack, just check to make                                sure whether the Island has been affected. We have had many tropical storm warnings over                                the years, but unlike Florida we’ve been extremely fortunate. In our opinion, the best                                offense is defense. </p>                            <p class="has-text-justified is-size-7" style="margin-top: 3rem;">We recommend                                purchasing travel insurance.                                Even the most basic travel insurance will provide some compensation if flights are                                canceled or the island is closed down due to a hurricane.</p>                            <p style="float:left;margin-top: 2rem;" class="is-size-7 has-text-justified">                                In 2006, the National Hurricane Center is                                predicting a hurricane season with 8 to 10 named storms.
